# Opening-a-restaurant-in-NYC
In this project NYC's restaurant and violation inspection data were parsed to find what factors would lead to the successful launch and operation of a restaurant in NYC. 
***
Partner Shadman Samad and I focused on the following: 
* Predicting the best location, time of year, and cuisine type to open the restaurant under.
* Predicting which violations to evade; those that can result in an immediate failed inspection and eventually the closure of a restaurant.
* Choosing a restaurant that can remain running in this competitive market.
***
We extracted our data from SQL, cleaned and parsed the data using python, and created visuals with python and tableau.
The project report can be found in the .pdf and the presentation in the .pptx.
